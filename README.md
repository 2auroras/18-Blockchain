## creating local blockchain using puppeth and geth

1) Use Puppeth to create the genesis block of our Proof of Work Blockchain
2) Use geth to create 2 nodes
3) Point the nodes to the JSON file containing our genesis block information
4) Begin mining by initializing our nodes, pointing the 2nd node to the enode of the first
5) Log into MyCrypto to see balance and send transactions (had trouble changing  networks)
